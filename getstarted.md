# Getting started #

Like any other freely available application the step one is configuring it.

**Step I**

Goto inches folder and open configure.php file and do the respective changes.
Similarly do the respective changes in admin/inches folder.


_"inches" folder seems weird right, well most of the cms follow the same site structure and hence most of them does have the same named folder i.e. include or includes.
Now even if I name it the same and then by mistake if i kept configure.php with some other name such as config.inc all my details are there to be seen by any Tom, Dick n Harry trying to peep in.
Hence just named it inches, i.e. inches far to be included from the index file. You can name the folder whatever you want but make same changes in index.php and configure folder._
